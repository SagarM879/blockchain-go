This README.md file is displayed on your project page. You should edit this 
file to describe your project, including instructions for building and 
running the project, pointers to the license under which you are making the 
project available, and anything else you think would be useful for others to
know.

We have created an empty license.txt file for you. Well, actually, it says,
"<Replace this text with the license you've chosen for your project.>" We 
recommend you edit this and include text for license terms under which you're
making your code available. A good resource for open source licenses is the 
[Open Source Initiative](http://opensource.org/).

Be sure to update your project's profile with a short description and 
eye-catching graphic.

Finally, consider defining some sprints and work items in Track & Plan to give 
interested developers a sense of your cadence and upcoming enhancements.

#new features:

#nodeJs server optimized [ok];
#demo.js using react.js (fixing great dom manipulation)[ ];
#easy frontend information about transactions(owners,assets,block_height,etc)[ ];
{ steps: 
      (1).open modal-div(fade-in) explaining the context => Industry (ledger's data)-> Shipping Company (ledger's data)-> Final Customer(ledger's data);
      (2).Explain the Smart Contract => show map,players and create an asset(right div) -> start demo;
      (3).switch animation flow to 45s;
      (4).enable Smart Contract over IoT real device && fake device
      (5).final summary;
}(appends) => IoT control enabled / fake temperature (+ -)
           => sla implementations(deadlines,etc)
           => final summary with multiple infractors;
